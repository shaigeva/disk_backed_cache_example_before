# Implementation Plan - DiskBackedCache

## Overview
Implementing a two-tier LRU cache for Pydantic objects with in-memory and SQLite storage.

**ALL STEPS ARE MANDATORY**

**Implementation order:** Follow the steps below in order. Each step is a complete, testable capability.

**Requirements source:** See `spec.md` for detailed feature requirements and behavior specifications.

## Notes

- Each step builds on previous steps
- See `spec.md` for detailed requirements
- Use `CLAUDE.md` for implementation workflow guidance
- Run `./devtools/run_all_agent_validations.sh` after each step
- Update checkboxes as steps are completed
